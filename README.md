### Introduction
The goal of this project is to study various parameters of large-scale graphs sourced from the web. Typically, these graphs are characterized by a high number of edges and vertices, making their analysis complex and computationally demanding. The focus will be on exploring graphs from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection, which models diverse social networks. These graphs are typically represented in text files containing information about their edges and vertices.

### Overview
This GitHub repository contains a C++ toolkit for analyzing and visualizing large-scale graphs sourced from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection.

### Key Features
1. **Graph Parameter Calculation:** Analyze various parameters such as vertices, edges, max degree, connected components, and cycles with 3 vertices.
2. **Degree Distribution Visualization:** Create graphical representations of the degree distribution for each graph.
3. **Degeneracy Computation:** Calculate the degeneracy for each graph using an iterative removal approach.

### Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amayes985-stack/Stanford-Algorithm-Project.git
   ```
2. **Compile and Run:**
   Follow the instructions in the README file for compilation and execution.

### Graph Format
Make sure to review and modify the format of graphs from the Stanford database as needed.
